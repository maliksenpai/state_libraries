# State Libraries

The purpose of this project is to make an example use of the commonly used state libraries. In this project I used the following libraries:

<ul>
    <li>Bloc</li>
    <li>Get</li>
    <li>Mobx</li>
    <li>Provider</li>
    <li>Riverpod</li>
</ul>

I made a Todo application with all these libraries as an example.
